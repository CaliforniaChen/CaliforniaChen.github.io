<b>Abstract:</b> Line drawing is a fundamental tool for shape description and cultural expression, it is also an essential element for Chinese traditional art. Simplicity is one of the main characteristics of many Chinese traditional artworks, but artists prefer sketching line drawings nowadays. Therefore, the simplification of line drawings has received more and more attention, especially in the culture computing domain. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of existing line drawing simplification methods. For vector line drawings, there are two major steps for simplification: stroke grouping and stroke merging. For raster line drawings, related works on simplification can be divided into three main categories: fitting-based methods, tracing-based methods, and learning-based methods. Finally, we conclude this review and discuss the key challenges of line drawing simplification for Chinese traditional art.
