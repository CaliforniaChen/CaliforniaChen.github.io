<b>Abstract:</b> We present a novel framework for instance segmentation of Multi-view Stereo (MVS) mesh models of buildings. Unlike existing works focusing on extracting semantically meaningful objects, the emphasis of this work lies in detecting and segmenting building instances even if they are adjacent and encoded in a large and imprecise 3D surface model. Multi-view RGB images are first lifted to RGBH images by adding a heightmap and are segmented to have all roof instances using a fine-tuned 2D instance segmentation neural network. Roof instance masks from different multi-view images are then clustered into global masks. Our mask clustering accounts for spatial occlusion and overlapping, which can eliminate ambiguities among multi-view images. Finally, 3D roof instances are segmented out by mask back-projections and extended to the entire building instances through an Markov random field (MRF) optimization. Quantitative evaluations and ablation studies show the effectiveness of all major steps of the method. We have also provided a dataset for the evaluation of instance segmentation of 3D building models. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first dataset for 3D instance segmentation of MVS buildings.

<b>Datasets:</b> We have created a benchmark dataset **InstanceBuilding** that contains annotation for both UAV images and 3D urban scenes simultaneously. To evaluate our 3D instance segmentation method, we annotated 3D roofs and buildings for 4 large 3D urban scenes. More details and download linkage can be found in the [Datasets page](https://californiachen.github.io/datasets/).
