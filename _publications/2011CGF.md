Abstract: We introduce a new technique called Implicit Brushes to render animated 3D scenes with stylized lines in real-time with temporal coherence. An Implicit Brush is deﬁned at a given pixel by the convolution of a brush footprint along a feature skeleton; the skeleton itself is obtained by locating surface features in the pixel neighborhood. Features are identiﬁed via image-space ﬁtting techniques that not only extract their location, but also their proﬁle, which permits to distinguish between sharp and smooth features. Proﬁle parameters are then mapped to stylistic parameters such as brush orientation, size or opacity to give rise to a wide range of line-based styles.
