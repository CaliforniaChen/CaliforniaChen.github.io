I am an Asistant Professor in the School of Computer Science of Zhejiang University of Technology. 

Before that, I received my joint Ph.D. between Bordeaux University (INRIA Bordeaux Sud-Ouest) in France and Zhejiang University (State Key Lab. of CAD&CG) in China, under the guidance of Qunsheng Peng, Xaiver Granier and Pascal Barla.

Research interests:
======
-	Computer Graphics (CG) and digital protection for cultural heritage (DPCH). I am doing researches in CG since I was a master student, and proposed many novel methods and solutions for CG, and recently very interested in promote these methods to DPCH, which is a very promising direction and earns a lot of attentions from both government and the people.

-	Visual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR). I am working on this domain more than 10 years, and published high quality papers for visualization of hidden objects in AR, obtained adequate funding to continue my research on them, and established long-term collaboration with industrial companies (like Alibaba company in China) and international research institution (like INRIA in France).

News:
