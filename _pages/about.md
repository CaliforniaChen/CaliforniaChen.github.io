- I am an Asistant Professor in the [School of Computer Science](http://www.cs.zjut.edu.cn/html/index.html) of [Zhejiang University of Technology](http://www.zjut.edu.cn/) since 2013. 

- Before that, I received my Ph.D.s from [manao](http://manao.inria.fr/) team in INRIA Bordeaux Sud-Ouest ([Université de Bordeaux](http://www.u-bordeaux.fr/) ) in France under the guidance of [Xaiver Granier](http://xgranier.free.fr/) and [Pascal Barla](https://www.labri.fr/perso/barla/blog/), and the [State Key Lab. of CAD&CG](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/) ([Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/) ) in China under the guidance of [Qunsheng Peng](http://www.cad.zju.edu.cn/home/peng/).
